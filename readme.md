# 🏡 Land Price Prediction App

A web application that predicts **land prices** using a **RandomForest Regression model** trained on 4 key features:

- **CRIM**: Crime rate per capita  
- **RM**: Average number of rooms per dwelling  
- **TAX**: Property tax per $10,000  
- **LSTAT**: % lower status population  

The app is built with **Flask** for the backend and a **styled HTML + JS frontend** for user interaction.
